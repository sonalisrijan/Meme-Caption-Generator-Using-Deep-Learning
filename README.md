# Meme Caption Generation Using Deep Learning

Significance: With the social media revolution, memes have increasingly begun to sculpt public emotion, especially of the younger generation. They're also gaining popularity as a strong political tool. 

In this project:
1. Generate captions using an input image and its label: An RNN (LSTM) model
2. Classify the caption generated into funny or not funny (1 or 0), and classify them as relevant or irrelevant (1 or 0)

The first part of the project constitutes the meme caption generator. This further includes two parts:
1. Encoder: To embed image data and its corresponding label 
2. Decoder: Generates the meme caption text using above embedding

The second part of the model constitutes the hilarity classifier and relevance classifier.
